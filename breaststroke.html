          The Chest style, also known as the Breaststroke, is considered the
          slowest of the swim styles recognized by the International Swimming
          Federation. The chest is the first style that swimmers learn since a
          calm and pleasant technique is used. But it is also one of the styles
          that costs the most to master since it requires a lot of coordination
          in the movements. About 50% of the work is distributed in the upper
          body and the lower body, since the kick plays a very important
          function when swimming.
