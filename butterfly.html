          It is one of the most striking within the discipline of swimming.
          However, this technique is also one of the most complex, demanding and
          strenuous, so you have to know its main aspects to execute it
          correctly.

                  The stroke in the butterfly technique is somewhat similar to
                  that performed in the crawl technique, but instead of doing it
                  alternately, it is performed simultaneously. In the same way,
                  both arms should be slightly flexed when entering water, which
                  is combined with a rotated posture in them, in which the
                  elbows must look up, and the hands out, forming a 45-degree
                  angle. This effect is achieved by the flexion that continually
                  occurs at the elbows. It is important that to complete the
                  stroke, the hands push back, reaching the height of the hips,
                  forming a movement in the form of a circle.

                  In the butterfly technique, certain head movements must be
                  carried out that will allow the swimmer to breathe properly,
                  recovering his breath to continue his movement in the pool. In
                  this way, when the stroke is making its external sweep, the
                  elevation of the head must be started so that the face is out
                  of the water, and the swimmer manages to take a breath. The
                  swimmer's face must then come out of the water at the same
                  time that the stroke sweeps upward, completing the movement in
                  the first phase of recovery. Later, in the second phase of
                  recovery, the face enters the water again, thus initiating a
                  new swimming cycle. It is also worth noting that breathing
                  should be done every two stroke cycles, although many swimmers
                  do it in each one.

                  It is characterized in that its kick is performed at the same
                  time as the stroke. Another aspect to consider in this
                  technique is that, during the kick, both legs move
                  simultaneously, and not alternatively, as would happen in the
                  crawl or back techniques. Finally, it should be borne in mind
                  that the kick in this technique originates from the hips,
                  which is why adequate toning is essential in that segment of
                  the body, to avoid fatigue.
