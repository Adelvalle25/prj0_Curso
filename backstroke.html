          In swimming, the back style is very similar to the crawl, only this
          time the swimmer floats with his back facing the water. The sequence
          of movements is worked alternately, that is, one arm in the air with
          the palm of the hand coming out from under the leg, while the other
          propels the body in the water.

                  The movement of the arms from a global perspective does not
                  offer too many disadvantages for learning, perhaps the most
                  important points would be to achieve a good depth and range of
                  movement. It would also be very important to incorporate,
                  although conceptually, the alternation and opposition in the
                  movement of the arms <br />
                  <br />

                  The student out of the water and standing performs arm
                  circumferences, taking as a reference that the movement is
                  close to the body at all times and that when one arm is raised
                  the other should be driving downwards <br />
                  <br />

                  In the water and with the help of a partner to hold it by the
                  feet, perform the movement of the arms. <br /><br />

                  In the water and with a float in the legs, perform the
                  movement of the arms. <br /><br />

                  Perform a section of the pool with leg movements and working
                  with one arm, the other at the side of the body. Then work
                  with the other. <br />
                  <br />

                  The same as above but working with one arm, then with the
                  other and then with both (to be able to do a double-stroke
                  back, the swimmer must have a good movement of the legs,
                  otherwise the position of his body in the water will be
                  permanently modified). <br />
                  <br />

                  Perform the back swim trying to recover the shoulders as much
                  as possible when the arms pass through the perpendicular.

                <p class="card-text">
                  It would be convenient to allocate some exercises in order for
                  the student to identify and grasp globally how the movement of
                  the legs is, they can be carried out out of the water and
                  accompanied by an explanation and argument by the teacher of
                  the most important points . In this way we would highlight the
                  alternate and opposite character in the movement of the legs
                  and the importance of it coming out of the hip joint in order
                  to ensure the student's understanding of the movement
                  amplitude factor. <br /><br />

                  Once in contact with the water and sitting on the edge of the
                  pool, perform the movement of the legs <br /><br />

                  In the water and taking the edge to perform the movement of
                  the legs in the dorsal position, the teacher or a partner may
                  begin to make some corrections regarding range of motion and
                  excessive flexion of the knees. <br /><br />

                  With the nape of the neck resting on the lifeline, the eyes
                  directed up and forward and with the arms at the side of the
                  body, perform the movement of the legs. <br /><br />

                  In the dorsal decubitus position and with the arms at the side
                  of the body perform the movement of the legs <br />
                  <br />

                  Idem anterior but accompany the movement of the legs with the
                  corresponding body roll <br />
                  <br />

                  Perform leg movement with one arm extended behind and the
                  other at the side of the body <br /><br />

                  Perform the movement of the legs with both arms extended
                  behind and hands clasped. <br /><br />

                <p class="card-text">
                  Breathing in the back swim does not offer major inconveniences
                  because the head is always out of the water, however it would
                  be convenient for the student to incorporate a respiratory
                  rhythm. Regarding coordination, it is necessary to permanently
                  emphasize the alternation and opposition in the movement of
                  the arms and not to allow the arms to join the side of the
                  body. <br /><br />

                  Perhaps the most recommended exercise to include coordination
                  would be to place one arm extended behind and the other at the
                  side of the body and each a predetermined number of leg
                  movements change position of the arms, so on until you swim
                  back without intermediate pauses. <br /><br />

                  The good result of a learning sequence lies in taking the
                  necessary time to allow the student to understand and
                  elaborate the movement proposal and in my understanding we
                  should give very simple exercises so as not to complicate the
                  student's elaboration. In any case, this form of swimming
                  requires an extremely long time for leg work if the final
                  desire is to have a student who swims well on his back.
